reading in file with expression data

``` r
data <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
```

quantities of each genotype

``` r
table(data$geno)
```

    ## 
    ## A/A A/G G/G 
    ## 108 233 121

statistics for A/A genotype: median is 31.25

``` r
summary(data[data$geno=="A/A",])
```

generate boxplot in base R; by using tilde, expression values are
grouped by genotype

``` r
boxplot(data$exp ~ data$geno)
```

I answered the next part of the question in the lab sheet; I will
include the answer here as well: The median expression for A/A is higher
than for G/G, but there is lots of overlap in their distributions, so
the difference may not be statistically significant. I would say that
SNP does not affect ORMDL3 expression.
